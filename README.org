* Kibera TB
** Tiemersma says that 2 years until self-cure or death
*** It is not possible in to self cure in our model -- we need to implement this.
** SEIR Model inaccuracy
In our code the Exposed state reflects the timestep in which someone was infected.
** Notes 4/31
*** do references to Tayler-Smith 2011 et al need to be updated?
*** goal selection section?
*** head of the family?
*** business popularity is uniform not normal
*** recovered can return to latent/suceptible
*** Active will become latent
*** However age is coded, reflect in documentation
** TODO Check head of family rules
** TODO Check that religion is set
** TODO Up and running with new version of Mason
** TODO Systematically review methodology section of ODD
*** TODO Make sure that the ODD reflects the code
*** DONE Make sure it's a complete ODD
** TODO Tayler-Smith et al 2011, TB Infection Prevalence Rate
Says Latent rate of 30%, "disease" rate of .064

Latest data says 567/100,000 = 0.00567

*** DONE Learn about how phases work
*** DONE How much does your bacilli count influence your likelihood of getting active TB?
Similar questions for Latent-exposed

*** TODO Check TB treatment rates without HIV, update code in ResidentTB::573

*** DONE Verify Equations in ODD
** TODO Check all references in ODD, make sure they are in bibliography
** TODO Review ODD, Verify against implementation in code
*** TODO Double Check Step-through SEIR, check phase transitions
**** DONE Check question marks in diagram
**** DONE Can latent TB disappear?
No, it will always be there.
*** TODO If you drop out, does treatment become less effective? (make sure paper reflects this)
    In real world, you may become drug resistant if you drop out. How does our model reflect this?
    It doesn't.
*** DONE Verify Control Flow:
**** Read spatial and demographic files
**** Create environment
**** Buiild Grids and displays
**** Create and place agents (assign personal information)
**** Schedule agents to update
**** Set TB and HIV parameters
**** introduce TB to an initial numbers of agents
**** Step
***** Go through list of agents, step each one randomly
***** agent determines what activity to perform based on inherent characterstics
***** Agent reach goal?
****** No? Move
****** Yes? Do Activity
**** TB Transmission 
**** Health Depreciation
***** Agent has TB?
****** Yes? Health depreciation (also changes contagious levels)
******* Agent on treatment?
******** Yes?
Initiate agent treatment, with enough time to make agent non-contagious. Can only be activated if disease is asymptomatic
**** Record results, update graphs
*** TODO Verify Goal Selection submodel
- [ ] Schools
- [ ] Religion
- [ ] Water
- [ ] Business
- [ ] Socialization
- [ ] Restaurants
- [ ] Work
*** DONE Jones el al 2009
*** DONE Can you be treated while you're latent for TB?
     I think no.
*** DONE Attrition rate vs mortality? Tayler smith
Attrition rate is how you drop out of program, mortality is dying
*** DONE make sure agents are created but only removed if die; no new agents added .. is reflected in the paper
*** DONE Verify Implementation of SEIR Submodel
**** DONE Step-through SEIR, check phase transitions
*** DONE Verify Parameter Values
- [ ] Table 1
- [ ] Table 2 Disease variables
- [ ] Table 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  mortalityRateLatentTB never used

  CD4CountDrop, CD4 Count for TB_max are commented out?
  CD4Count is never used in ResidentTB.java; quite a few others like this
  
**** DONE Read Patterson, 2012, determine HIV prevalence rate, correct in text
This was correct, so I fixed in model. 
**** DONE salivaPerCough is 6*10^(-7), not 6e8
**** Confirm HIV survival time in table 10?
** Write Background for Paper
*** Do Research
- on both ABMs and other TB modeling
- make folder
- use google scholar
- put the reference, one sentence, similarities/differences from our model
- model has to be unique (what is the contribution to science), how is ours better
 
*** Writeup / making the argument 
**** What is TB (already have)
**** How has it been studied?
ABM/SD/MATH/CA
Might me models of population, but also internal models
**** How is ours better

while tb has been studied from vac/medicine POV (recent), attention has also been placed on modeling
Why model? hard to understand the future
can't test intervention on people, want to do it in silico
many modeling approaches, traditionally mathematical/system dynamics (add a few citations)

Turning to ABMs - heterogeneity, individual movement and interactions, 

Initial work includes Bob et al, who did X + Y, while smith et all shows this
But in our model we do XY which makes ours different and better

When looking at ABM models, keep a check on what disease model using (SIR, SEIR)

***** Fix CDI 
***** TODO Fix Seabright
***** TODO Verify Results
****** Parameter testing


***** Model runs, but this might be difficult due to the time it takes to run the model etc. or if changes are needed.
   
***** Paper/ Conceptual:

What happens if you remove segregation/ethnicities? how much more or less accurate does it get?

****** Where are people being exposed?
******* Schools/Businesses?
******* Every time somone gets exposed, log their xy, time, activity, agent ID
******* Then create a shapefile of points
** DONE Remake figures using lucidchart
*** Activity Diagram
*** SEIR
